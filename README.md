# Squaddie

A personal issue I had with XCOM 2 was that I absolutely loved seeing people I personally knew, whether they be scientist who were little more than names on a spreadsheet to the actualy soldiers that I controlled and bonded with each misssion. XCOM 2 was brillaint in allowing this to be possible through their character pool system which allowed you to make units before starting a save game and then have them naturally appear throughout the course of a campaign.

However, there was a major issue I had with their implementation. The Interface for making a new character, customising them and changing their name was so slow and full of animations that just made making a huge quantity of characters a far too time intensive task. Squaddie is a utility that reads the native Character Pool binary format and also writes to the same format. Using it you can quickly (for example) fetch a large list of names from your social media site of choice and then generate a bunch of unique characters with specific names.

The project initially was going to receive a graphical user interface and a proper amount of documentation. However, before the release of XCOM 2: War of the Chosen they drastically increased the menu animation speeds and the general feel of doing anything in the interface which satisfied me enough to stop working on the project.
